			"question":"Each computer has a built-in instruction set that it knows how to execute by design.",
			"hint":"Recall that we use the term computation to mean “the execution of a sequence of instructions by a computer with the intention of solving a given problem”.A computer should know how to perform certain basic instructions for it to be able to do any computation at all.",
			"options":[
				"=True",
				"~False"
			],
			"id":"1",
			"correct":"Correct. This set typically includes simple instructions for doing arithmetic and logic operations, moving data between the processing and storage units, and for determining which instruction is to be executed next.",
			"incorrect":"Incorrect. Each computer has a set of primitive instructions that it is “wired” to execute. We call this the instruction set of the computer."
		},
		{
			"question":"The computer uses intelligence to execute instructions.",
			"hint":"Recall that we said a computer executes the instructions given to it mechanically.Mechanical computation means, automated computation without any thought.",
			"options":[
				"~True",
				"=False"
			],
			"id":"2",
			"correct":"Correct. A computer executes instructions automatically. Its main task is to simply execute the instructions given to it (from its instruction set) and remember their results as the computation goes on. The part that may require intelligence is expressing a computation in terms of those instructions.",
